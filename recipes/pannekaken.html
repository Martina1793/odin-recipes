        <h3><em>My Norwegian grandmother made these pancakes for us as a treat, and they continue to be a favorite when my mother makes them for my kids. They're very easy and versatile — serve them rolled like crêpes with syrup or jam. Or serve them for dessert stuffed with sweetened cream cheese and lingonberry jam.</em></h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>Combine milk and eggs in a blender; add flour, sugar, and salt and blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Spray a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium-high heat. Scoop about 1/4 cup batter into the skillet, and tilt the pan until the batter coats the bottom. Cook until the top looks dry, about 30 seconds. Carefully slide a spatula under the pancake and flip. Cook just until browned on the other side, about 3 seconds. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining batter.</li>
