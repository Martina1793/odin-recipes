        <h3>I was raised on lefse as a special treat for the holidays. We still make it every holiday season and this is the best recipe ever. We eat ours with butter and sugar. Note: you will need a potato ricer to prepare this recipe.</h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10 pounds potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>⅓ cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Run hot potatoes through a potato ricer into a large bowl. Beat butter, cream, salt, and sugar into riced potatoes. Let cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Stir flour into potato mixture to form a soft dough. Pull off pieces of dough and form into walnut-sized balls.</li>
            <li>Lightly flour a clean cloth and roll out lefse balls to 1/8-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle over high heat.</li>
            <li>Cook lefse on the hot griddle until brown blisters form, about 1 minute per side. Place cooked lefse on a damp towel to cool slightly. Repeat with remaining dough, stacking them on top of each other as they're cooked; cover until ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
